    description: "Assay CHEMBL3705464: Time Resolved Fluorescence Energy Transfer (TR-FRET) Assay: The inhibition of p53-MDM2 and p53-MDM4 interactions is measured by time resolved fluorescence energy transfer (TR-FRET). Fluorescence energy transfer (or Foerster resonance energy transfer) describes an energy transfer between donor and acceptor fluorescent molecules. For this assay, human MDM2 protein (amino acids 2-188) and human MDM4 protein (amino acids 2-185), tagged with a C-terminal biotin moiety, are used in combination with a Europium labeled streptavidin (Perkin Elmer, Inc., Waltham, Mass., USA) serving as the donor fluorophore. The p53 derived, Cy5 labeled peptide Cy5-TFSDLWKLL (p53 aa18-26) is the energy acceptor. Upon excitation of the donor molecule at 340 nm, binding interaction between MDM2 or MDM4 and the p53 peptide induces energy transfer and enhanced response at the acceptor emission wavelength at 665 nm."

    description: "Assay CHEMBL3705362: Mobility-Shift kinase assay: Compounds of the examples provided herein were assessed for their ability to inhibit Syk kinase by utilizing Caliper Life Sciences' proprietary LabChip technology. The off-chip incubation mobility-shift kinase assay uses a microfluidic chip to measure the conversion of a fluorescent peptide substrate to a phosphorylated product. The reaction mixture, from a microtiter plate well, is introduced through a capillary sipper onto the chip, where the nonphosphorylated substrate and phosphorylated product are separated by electrophoresis and detected via laser induced fluorescence. The signature of the fluorescence signal over time reveals the extent of the reaction. The phosphorylated product migrates through the chip faster than the non-phosphorylated substrate, and signals from the two forms of the peptide appear as distinct peaks."

Cells were passaged frequently, every 3-5 days, to avoid overgrowth, depletion of essential medium components, or acidic medium exposure. Cells were passaged using a brief wash in 0.05% trypsin with 1 mM EDTA, followed by dissociation in divalent-free phosphate-buffered saline (Hyclone #SH30028.02). Dissociated cells were seeded onto poly-D-lysine coated black-walled 96-well plates (Biocoat; Becton Dickinson #354640) at about 40,000 cells per well and grown for approximately 1 day in culture medium to near confluency. The assay buffer was composed of 130 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM HEPES, 5 mM glucose, and either 2 mM or 20 μM CaCl2. On the day of the experiment, the culture medium was replaced with 2 mM calcium assay buffer using an automated plate washer (ELx405; Biotek, VT). The cells were incubated in 100 μL/well Fluo-3/AM (2 μM; TEFLabs #0116) with Pluronic F127 (100 μg/mL; Sigma #P2443) for 1 h at rt in the dark. After loading the cells, the dye solution was replaced with 50 μL/well of 20 μM calcium assay buffer using the ELx405 plate washer. Test compounds (50 μL/well) were added to the plate and incubated for 30 min. Intracellular Ca2+ levels were subsequently assayed using a Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader (FLIPR™ instrument, Molecular Devices, CA) to simultaneously monitor Fluo-3 fluorescence in all wells (λexcitation=488 nm, λemission=540 nm) during challenge with agonist (capsaicin). The IC50 values were determined. Cells were challenged with 150 nM capsaicin and the fluorescence counts were captured following agonist addition at a sampling rate of 0.33 Hz. The contents of the wells were mixed 3 times (40 μL mix volume) immediately after the additions were made. Concentration dependence of block was determined by exposing each well of cells in duplicate rows of a 96 well plate to a serial dilution of test compound. The concentration series usually started at 10 Î¼M with a three-fold serial decrement in concentration. The magnitude of the capsaicin response was determined by measuring the change in fluo3 fluorescence before and 100 seconds after the addition of the agonist."

His-tagged first (BD1: amino acids K57-E168) and second (BD2: amino acids E352-E168) bromodomains of human BRD4 were expressed and purified. An Alexa647-labeled BET-inhibitor was used as the fluorescent probe in the assay. Compound dilution series were prepared in DMSO via a 3-fold serial dilution from 2.5 mM to 42 nM. Compounds were then diluted 6:100 in assay buffer (20 mM Sodium Phosphate, pH 6.0, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt dihydrate, 0.01% Triton X-100, 1 mM DL-Dithiothreitol) to yield 3× working solutions. Six microliters (L) of the working solution was then transferred to white, low-volume assay plates (Costar #3673). A 1.5× assay mixture containing His-tagged bromodomain, Europium-conjugated anti-His antibody (Invitrogen PV5596) and the Alexa-647-conjugated probe molecule was also prepared. Twelve L of this solution were added to the assay plate to reach a final volume of 18 L. The final concentration of 1× assay buffer contains 2% DMSO, 50 M-0.85 nM compound, 8 nM His-tagged bromodomain, 1 nM Europium-conjugated anti-His-tag antibody and 100 nM or 30 nM probe (for BDI or BDII, respectively). After a one-hour incubation at room temperature, TR-FRET ratios were determined using an Envision multilabel plate reader (Ex 340, Em 495/520)."

  CHEMBL3888977:
    description: "Assay CHEMBL3888977: Biochemical Assay: The FASN enzyme was isolated from SKBr3 cells. SKBr3 is a human breast cancer cell-line with high levels of FASN expression. It is estimated that FASN comprises about 25% of the cytosolic proteins in this cell line. SKBr3 cells were homogenized in a dounce homogenizer then centrifuged for 15 minutes at 4° C. to remove particulate matter. The supernatant was then analyzed for protein content, diluted to the appropriate concentration, and used to measure FASN activity. The presence of FASN was confirmed by western blot analysis. A similar method for isolation of FASN from SKBr3 cells is described in Teresa, P. et al. (Clin. Cancer Res. 2009; 15(24), 7608-7615). FASN activity of the SKBr3 cell extract was determined by measuring either NADPH oxidation or the amount of thiol-containing coenzyme A (CoA) released during the fatty acid synthase reaction. The dye CPM (7-diethylamino-3-(4'-maleimidyl-phenyl)-4-methylcoumarin) contains a thiol reactive group that increases its fluorescence emission on reaction with the sulfhydryl group of CoA."

Cells were released from culture flasks using trypsin/EDTA, harvested, washed twice with ice-cold PBS (without Ca2+ and Mg2+), pelleted at 1,000 rpm for 5 min at 4° C., frozen and stored at -80° C. Frozen pellets were suspended in 20 ml HEPES-NaOH (20 mM, pH 7.4) containing 10 mM EDTA and homogenized with a Polytron (PT 6000, Kinematica) at 14,000 rpm for 20 s. The homogenate was centrifuged at 48,000Ã¿g for 30 min at 4° C. Subsequently, the supernatant was removed and discarded, and the pellet resuspended in 20 ml HEPES-NaOH (20 mM, pH 7.4) containing 0.1 mM EDTA using the Polytron (20 s at 14,000 rpm). This procedure was repeated and the final pellet resuspended in HEPES-NaOH containing 0.1 mM EDTA and homogenized using the Polytron. Typically, aliquots of 2 ml membrane portions were stored at -80° C. With each new membrane batch the dissociation constant (Kd) was determined via a saturation curve. The TAAR1 radioligand 3[H]â¿¿(S)-4-[(ethyl-phenyl-amino)-methyl]-4,5-dihydro-oxazol-2-ylamine (described in WO 2008/098857) was used at a concentration equal to the calculated Kd value, that was usually around 2.3 nM, resulting in the binding of approximately 0.2% of the radioligand and a specific binding representing approximately 85% of the total binding. Nonspecific binding was defined as the amount of 3[H]â¿¿(S)-4-[(ethyl-phenyl-amino)-methyl]-4,5-dihydro-oxazol-2-ylamine bound in the presence of 10 uM unlabeled ligand. All compounds were tested at a broad range of concentrations (10 pM to 10 uM) in duplicates. The test compounds (20 ul/well) were transferred into a 96 deep well plate (TreffLab), and 180 ul of HEPES-NaOH (20 mM, pH 7.4) containing MgCl2 (10 mM) and CaCl2 (2 mM) (binding buffer), 300 ul of the radioligand 3[H]â¿¿(S)-4-[(ethyl-phenyl-amino)-methyl]-4,5-dihydro-oxazol-2-ylamine at a concentration of 3.3xKd in nM and 500 ul of the membranes (resuspended at 50 ug protein per ml) added. The 96 deep well plates were incubated for 1 hr at 4° C. Incubations were terminated by rapid filtration through Unifilter-96 plates (Packard Instrument Company) and glass filters GF/C (Perkin Elmer) presoaked for 1 hr in polyethylenimine (0.3%) and washed 3 times with 1 ml of cold binding buffer. After addition of 45 ul of Microscint 40 (PerkinElmer) the Unifilter-96 plate was sealed and after 1 hr the ratioactivity counted using a TopCount Microplate Scintillation Counter (Packard Instrument Company)."

    description: "Assay CHEMBL3888980: Functional Assay: The assay was performed as described below, using HEK293 cells transfected with rat TRPV1 (rTRPV1/HEK293). These cells had a geneticin selection marker and were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Gibco BRL) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin (50 units/mL), and 500 μg/mL geneticin in 5% CO2 at 37° C. Cells were passaged frequently, every 3-5 days, to avoid overgrowth, depletion of essential medium components, or acidic medium exposure. Cells were passaged using a brief wash in 0.05% trypsin with 1 mM EDTA, followed by dissociation in divalent-free phosphate-buffered saline (Hyclone #SH30028.02). Dissociated cells were seeded onto poly-D-lysine coated black-walled 96-well plates (Biocoat; Becton Dickinson #354640) at about 40,000 cells per well and grown for approximately 1 day in culture medium to near confluency. The assay buffer was composed of 130 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM HEPES, 5 mM glucose, and either 2 mM or 20 μM CaCl2. On the day of the experiment, the culture medium was replaced with 2 mM calcium assay buffer using an automated plate washer (ELx405; Biotek, VT). The cells were incubated in 100 μL/well Fluo-3/AM (2 μM; TEFLabs #0116) with Pluronic F127 (100 μg/mL; Sigma #P2443) for 1 h at rt in the dark. After loading the cells, the dye solution was replaced with 50 μL/well of 20 μM calcium assay buffer using the ELx405 plate washer. Test compounds (50 μL/well) were added to the plate and incubated for 30 min. Intracellular Ca2+ levels were subsequently assayed using a Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader (FLIPR™ instrument, Molecular Devices, CA) to simultaneously monitor Fluo-3 fluorescence in all wells (λexcitation=488 nm, λemission=540 nm) during challenge with agonist (capsaicin). The IC50 values were determined. Cells were challenged with 150 nM capsaicin and the fluorescence counts were captured following agonist addition at a sampling rate of 0.33 Hz. The contents of the wells were mixed 3 times (40 μL mix volume) immediately after the additions were made. Concentration dependence of block was determined by exposing each well of cells in duplicate rows of a 96 well plate to a serial dilution of test compound. The concentration series usually started at 10 Î¼M with a three-fold serial decrement in concentration. The magnitude of the capsaicin response was determined by measuring the change in fluo3 fluorescence before and 100 seconds after the addition of the agonist."
